# AndroidSecureCrypto v0.3.0 Release Notes

## Overview
Third major release adding key derivation functionality via HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function). This release continues our focus on hardware security integration and memory safety while expanding the cryptographic capabilities available to applications.

## Features

### Key Derivation (New)
- HKDF key derivation (RFC 5869)
  - Multiple hash algorithm support: SHA-256, SHA-512
  - Legacy SHA-1 support for compatibility
  - Domain separation for derived keys
  - Flexible key size configuration
  - Hardware-accelerated when available

- Enhanced Security Features:
  - Memory-safe implementation with automatic cleanup
  - Side-channel attack mitigations
  - Constant-time operations
  - Domain and context separation
  - Comprehensive parameter validation

- Flexible API Options:
  - Simple default configuration
  - Customizable hash algorithms
  - Configurable output key sizes
  - Domain-based key separation
  - Context-specific derivation

### Symmetric Encryption (Improved)
- Enhanced memory handling
- Better error reporting
- Performance optimizations
- Improved testing coverage

### Random Number Generation (Improved)
- Enhanced entropy collection
- Improved memory efficiency
- Additional statistical tests
- Better error handling

## Security Considerations

### Key Derivation
- Minimum master key size: 16 bytes
- Default output size: 32 bytes
- Recommended algorithm: SHA-256
- Domain separation required
- Context uniqueness enforced

### Memory Safety
- Automatic master key cleanup
- Secure parameter handling
- Resource cleanup guarantees
- Process isolation enforcement

### Hardware Security
- Hardware-backed operations when available
- Automatic fallback to software implementation
- Security level detection and reporting
- Side-channel attack protections

## Implementation Details

### HKDF Implementation
- Extract-then-Expand paradigm
- Multiple hash algorithm support
- Fixed null salt for extract phase
- Configurable output length
- Automatic cleanup of intermediates

### Key Sizes
- Master key: 16+ bytes
- Default output: 32 bytes
- SHA-256: 32 byte output
- SHA-512: 64 byte output
- SHA-1: 20 byte output (legacy)

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient key generation
- Memory usage improvements
- Batch operation support
- Hardware acceleration detection

## Breaking Changes
None. All new functionality is additive.

## Known Issues
- Legacy SHA-1 support marked as deprecated
- Hardware acceleration not available on some devices

## Usage Requirements
- Android API 23 or higher
- Kotlin Coroutines
- AndroidX Security Crypto library

## Example Usage

### Basic Key Derivation
```kotlin
val masterKey = Random.generateBytes(32).getOrThrow()
try {
    val derivedKey = KeyDerivation.deriveKey(
        masterKey = masterKey,
        domain = "myapp.encryption",
        context = "user-data-key"
    ).getOrThrow()

    derivedKey.use { bytes ->
        // Use derived key
    }
} finally {
    masterKey.fill(0)
}
```

### Custom Algorithm Selection
```kotlin
val derivedKey = KeyDerivation.deriveKey(
    masterKey = masterKey,
    domain = "myapp.signing",
    context = "metadata-key",
    keySize = 64,
    algorithm = HkdfAlgorithm.SHA512
).getOrThrow()
```

## Future Plans
- Asymmetric encryption
- Digital signatures
